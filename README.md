# LiveSplitToUrn
Python script to convert a .lss LiveSplit file to a JSON file for use with Urn

This is public domain code, cuz I needed this a lot and if you do too, I want to save someone half an hour.
Feel free to submit issues and crap.

Usage: `python main.py input_file.lss [output_file.json]`
Will write to `stdout` if output file isn't provided.

You can test it with the Portal 2 Speedrun Mod LiveSplit file included.
